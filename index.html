<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<pre>
There was a time when silence wasn’t awkward,
when eyes met without distraction,
when moments weren’t measured by likes,
but by how they made us feel.

In the gentle hush of now,
we once knew how to live.

Today, the world hums loudly —
with buzzing phones,
endless to-do lists,
and hearts half-here, half-there.

We multitask through meals,
scroll through sunsets,
and capture memories we never truly lived.

But presence —
true, deep, sacred presence —
is a soft rebellion.
It is sitting still with your coffee,
watching the steam rise like a morning prayer.
It is listening — not to reply —
but to understand.
It is holding space for the moment,
without needing to fix it, post it, or filter it.
